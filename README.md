## Build the Agent
- Due to all the questions & interest, I've decided to bring the next cohort forward. Instead of waiting until June, the next cohort will start on April 23rd.
- Places are very limited, if you were on the waitlist you should have received an email already. I expect this to sell out fast. If you want to join, head to https://8020agent.com/build for more info.
